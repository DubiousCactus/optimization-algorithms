# Introduction
Implementation of different optimization / classification algorithms. This was done as a research project for the MSc. in Computer Engineering.
The different classifiers implemented are tested on two sets of data:

- *MNIST*: A set of 70K (vectorized) 28x28 pixel images depicting hand-written images
- *ORL*: A set of 400 (vectorized) 40x30 facial images depicting 40 persons

# Algorithms implemented

The following classification algorithms are implemented:

- Nearest class centroid
- Nearest sub-class centroid
- Nearest neighbor
- Perceptron trained using backpropagation
- Perceptron trained using MSE
